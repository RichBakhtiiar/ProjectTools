## Setup Lighting Content

The section provides you with the ability to automatically create needed *Lighting* on the scene. Please, use the default list of the items in this section.

## Auto Setup Folder

The section provides you with the ability to sort every object with the prefixes in the *World Outliner*. You can add additional prefixes if needed and the name of the folder, in which objects with those prefixes will be placed by plugin. Example: if you have a point light with the name “SM_Doors_Door_01”, the plugin will set the folder path to the “Meshes/Door/SM_Doors_Door_01” in the *World Outliner*.

## Auto Setup Pack

The section provides you with the ability to name the folder in which all of the objects without the prefixes will be placed.

## Setup Affect Distance Field Lighting

The section provides you with the ability to set to true / false Affect Distance Filed Lighting boolean on all static meshes on the current level. Useful for Virtual Production purposes.
